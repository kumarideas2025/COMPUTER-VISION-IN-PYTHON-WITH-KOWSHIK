VIDEO PROCESS WORKFLOW-->

WHAT IS A VIDEO?
=> IS JUST COLLECTION OF IMAGES.(30-60 IMAGE IN PER SECOND)

WHAT USE WEBCAM?

WHAT IS FRAME?
IS A PHOTO WHICH IS APART OF VIDEO CHAIN.
I1..I2..I3..FINAL IMAGE...EVERY I1 IS FRAME(1 SINGLE IMAGE)
1 SINGLE VIDEO=MANY FRAMES.



 






cv2.VideoCapture()-->
can open webcam on machine, video file,can read video file one by one
so that we can read the frames.
example: from many animal species and people .find people we use it.

source---if we use webcam from internal webcam then use0 or external use 1.
cap=cv2.VideoCapture(source)

cap.read()?
 1st ret  that will return TRUE or FALSE And  2nd is frame

  cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF==ord('k') 
  means ..wait 1 mm second if then we did not press any key that will return -1
  OR we press any key it will return keycode. keycode means ascii number of that key. [if the keycode is match with with the ord('key')....then the loop will break]
  &0xFF means bitwise operation...(in windows / linux they just return some crazy key  values so that 0xFF will  fix the values in right key).
  ord('k)..with the help of odd function we find the ascii number of k.








FRAME BY FRAME PROCESSING=> (take action in every frame)..
like for Kowshik face drawing a circle , Kumar face drawing a rectangle
detect every (face,eye,cars nameplate) with some action over it.
analysis-->color,size,motion,labeling,speed tracking,
specific time image save ...
F1=>DETECT PERSON ,DRAW A BOX.
F2=>DETECT PERSON ,DRAW that BOX.
...FINAL VIDEO
usage->self driving car,snapchat filter,with the face movement frame is changed.










saving Webcam videos to a file with openCv--->

VideoCaption(0) [for open camera]   ,  videoWriter()[for recording] , .release()[to stop camera]
step-1> open camera
step-2> height and width
step-3>recording start and save it though a file
step-4>show 
step-5> k press to quite

cv2.VideoWriter(filename,codec,fps,frame_size) 

.avi--> audio video interleave  
open cv will write on .avi using XVID codeC(compression format)

fps=>frame per second
 
frame size:
cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH- Width of the frames in the video stream.
cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT- Height of the frames in the video stream.
