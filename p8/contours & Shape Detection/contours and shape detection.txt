                    FINDING AND DRAWING CONTOURS IN OPENCV

contours are curves that join all the continuous points along a boundary that have the same color or intensity.
They are useful for shape analysis, object detection, and recognition. 
Contours can be used to find the outline of objects in an image.(find binary image==> black &white image)
which can then be used for various applications such as shape matching, object tracking, and image segmentation..

***********cv2.findContours()

contours,hierarchy=cv2.findContours(image,mode,method)


image==. binary image(balck and white)
mode=>retrieval mode (RETR_TREE)..all shapes with hierarchy , (RETR_EXTERNAL)...outpoint shape, (RETR_LIST)...witout hierarchy  
      .how many of contrast have to return  & what kind of contrast of contrast .

method=>approximation method.how much information is to return for each contours.
there are two things->

1.cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE     --> this will store corner point.this will save memory.      [shape detection]
2.cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_ONE        -->every pixel of the corner and it is very details.         [hand  writing detection]



contours==> we find a list of every outline  point in a shape.
hierarchy==> all information of all Contours.(parent to  child).




******cv2.drawContours()----> that will create a outer line in inner box shape element. like you have to find a square into a square. and use it to give outer line , for find the inner square.
cv2.drawContours(image,contours,contour_index,color,thickness)

contour_index---> -1/1..which shape is to draw. 0 means first shape draw. 1 means second shape draw.-1 all shapes have to be draw.



                                          SHAPE-DETECTION

********approxPolyDP()--->BY COUNTING THERE CORNER :

approx=cv2.approxpolyDP(contour,epsilon,True)                                                                                        
[0.01*cv2.arclength(contour),True]

contour/shape-->
small=more pre-size,more point
larger=rougher,fewer point

arclength= a total length of rope / total length of a triangle.

True==> start and end are closed in contour.
False==> there is a open line in contour.


why 0.01*length/ 0.1*length ???
=> it means epsilon ...more closely look is possible. epsilon WILL TELL SIMPL-FLY SHAPE HOW MUCH CLOSER TO ORIGINAL.
example: if a circle is smaller than it is easy to raf there circle.




***************SHAPE        ARC-LENGTH         epsilon
            small (TRIANGLE)   200PX           0.01*200
            larger(SQUARE)     800PX           0.01*800
            circle(big)        1200PX          0.01*1200
