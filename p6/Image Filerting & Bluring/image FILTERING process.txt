GOAL--> BETTER IMAGE, CLEAR IMAGE, SMOOTH IMAGE.

1.IMAGE FILTERING------->
SHARP ----> SMOOTH.(CLEAR RAF AREA).


2.BLURING--->
FOCUS ON MAIN OBJECT.
TYPES--> GAUSSIAN BLUR , MEDIAN BLUR , BILATERAL BLUR , NORMAL BLUR.

3.NOISE----->
BY USING IT WE FILTER OUT IT.

FLITTERING --. CHANGE EVERY PIXEL USING IT'S 

4.KERNEL-->
MINI SQUARE [LIKE: 3 X 3] matrix. will tell what to do with central pixel



Gaussian Blur--->( image soft , remove dust,shrap edges ,remove noise, preprocessing)
blurred_image = cv2.GaussianBlur(image,(kernel_size_x,kernel_size_y),sigma)

******kernel_size_x,kernel_size_y=== they are windows size and they are always [odds]****


kernel size==>
(3,3)--> light-blur
(9,9)-->strong-blur
(21,21)--> super blur








Median blur---> to remove random black and white
blurred=cv2.medianBlur(image,kernel_size)
we can clean image  by replacing each pixel with middle value.
will do in 3 steps->
find group of pixel.
according to there brightness value sward them.
find-out the middle value.


*****Here we replace our center value with average value
we use that to implement fine to car . with that only show number plate other nosic is blurred.



Sharpening-->
cv2.filter2D(src, ddepth ,kernel)
will make picture more clear and crisp. highlights edges and boost the contrast between pixel.....mean swe can saw the outline very clear from a image outline.
ddepth-> -1
here wwe also use numpy

sharpen_kernel=np.array([
    [0,-1,0],
    [-1,5,-1],
    [0,-1,0]
])
here we can see 5 number is the most brightest area in image. -1 are make them little dumb so that 5 is visible clearly . 0 makes no change in the corner edges.
