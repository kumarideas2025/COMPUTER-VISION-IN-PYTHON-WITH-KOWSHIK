GAOL--> CAN BREAKOUT SHAPE AND OUT STRUCTURE OF ANY IMAGE.

CANNY EDGE DETECTION-->DETECT OUT EDGE OF ANY IMAGE.
IMAGE THRESHOLDING---> UNCLEAR IMAGE TO BLACK AND WHITE CLEAR IMAGE(OBJECT DETECTION AND MASKING).
BITWISE OPERATION---> COMBINE IMAGE ,CUT SHAPES.



*********CANNY EDGES DETECTION:
edges=cv2.Canny(image,threshold1,threshold2)

we find a edge in a image where brightness is changed suddenly.
.>to detect border
.>separate object
.>feature extraction
.>sketch drawing
.>face  recognization 

****** threshold:
threshold1=>  lower bound to detect weak edges.  
threshold2=>  upper bound to detect strong edges.
(to set a cutoff mark)... like full or full black.

*****Bitwise operator:
1.2 image COMBINE
2.cut OUT
3.flip/remove

cv2.bitwise_and(img1,img2)..cutout shape from another images...The result will show the overlapping area where both images have non-zero values.
cv2.bitwise_or(img2,img1).....combined 2 into 1......The result will show all areas where either image has non-zero values.
cv2.bitwise_not(img1,img2)....AND (FACE AREA FROM MASS),OR (ADD SOMETHING),NOT(opposite opf original image).......which inverts the pixel values (black becomes white and vice versa).
